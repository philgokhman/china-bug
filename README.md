CHINA BUG

This was a small project I made during my free time, in a tribute to the 2001 Code Red bug. The HTML/JS can be injected into a site's source code, essentially overwriting the page's layout and giving the user an interesting payload.

**{RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER RUN IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE, AS THE PAYLOAD CAN AND WILL CAUSE LAG AND POTENTIALLY CRASH THE SYSTEM. USE AT OWN RISK.}**

I might add some CSS elements for a UI, but I see no reason for it right now.
