CHINA BUG

chinabug.html - the bug itself.
vulnerable airbnb.html - AirBnbB injected with the bug.

Notes:

*User must disable popup blocking, or else the payload will not trigger due to the capabilities of HTML/Javascript. Only the site would be incapacitated, but not the user.

*I might add some CSS elements for a UI, but I see no reason for it right now.

**{RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER RUN IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE, AS THE PAYLOAD CAN AND WILL CAUSE LAG AND POTENTIALLY CRASH THE SYSTEM. USE AT OWN RISK.}**
