CHINA BUG

This was a small project I made during my free time, in a tribute to the 2001 Code Red worm. The HTML/JS can be injected into a site's source code, essentially overwriting the page's layout and giving the user an interesting payload.

Notes:

*User must disable popup blocking, or else the payload will not trigger due to the capabilities of HTML/Javascript. Only the site would be incapacitated, but not the user.

*I might add some CSS elements for a UI, but I see no reason for it right now.

**{RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER RUN IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE, AS THE PAYLOAD CAN AND WILL CAUSE LAG AND POTENTIALLY CRASH THE SYSTEM. USE AT OWN RISK.}**
